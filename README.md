# Monocular SLAM with MDE for Dense Point Clouds & YOLO for dynamic object detection

This SLAM library is a monocular SLAM library designed to produce dense point clouds in real-time. By integrating MDE and object detection, dense point clouds can be generated and visulized in realtime in bevy.

# Note
This project is in a very early state. Everything is subject to change and is currently not ready for production or testing.

# Contributing
